      "project_name": "Biome Atlas",
      "about": "Biome Atlas began as a desire to get more people to care about their environment by being able to see all the interesting forms of life that live on Earth. I believe that learning empathy at a young age is the best approach. I designed Biome Atlas to teach children about the seven environmental biomes on Earth, including the animals and vegetation that inhabit them. Utilizing a custom Rails json API, the backend database was built to securely store and send information of biomes, animals, and plants. Implementing React and Redux to handle over 10 states, created 8 routes, and passed information between over 25 components. Designed user interface, slider, and forms with Semantic UI React, custom CSS, and React Transition Group. Used react library Strider to create an interactive quiz.",
