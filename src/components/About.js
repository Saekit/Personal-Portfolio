        <p>I am a Flatiron School coding bootcamp alumna! There I learned Ruby and JavaScript programming languages and how to work with others on a team to complete large projects.</p>
        <h3>Life Before Coding:</h3>
        <p>I was working full time and taking classes to attend a masterâ€™s program for nutrition. After two years, I took a break for family reasons and moved back home for a few months. Back home I wanted to try something new so I opened a pop-up restaurant with a friend and the two of us ran the business everyday, 12 hours a day, for almost 6 months. It was exhausting, but a great experience that helped me realize that I can really do anything with the right amount of effort, dedication, and enthusiasm.</p>
        <p> It was after this experience that I went back to what I used to like doing as a child, coding. So I started to teach myself how to code using online and offline resources and found that coding felt so right to me. I moved back to Brooklyn and attended the coding bootcamp where I was able to focus on coding, grasp more programming concepts and dive further into my creative abilities while learning to work with others through pair programming.</p>
        <h3>Life Now:</h3>
        <p>I'm still living in NYC where I am studying programming on my own, coding everyday, and loving every learning moment. I frequently get together with my fellow Flatiron alumni to pair program and study algorithms together.</p>
        <p>Live, Love, Code</p>
